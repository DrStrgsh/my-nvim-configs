# My NeoVim configs

#### I'm use [Vim-Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) for install plugins

After download *__init.vim__* open this file with vim/nvim and run command ```:so %``` and after that ```:PlugInstall```

For the *__deoplete.nvim__* to work properly you need to do steps on [this link](https://github.com/Shougo/deoplete.nvim#requirements)
